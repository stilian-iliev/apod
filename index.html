			<p id="explanation" class="overview">The second Death Star, sometimes referred to as Death Star II, was a massive battle station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet. Following the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin">Battle of Yavin</a> and the destruction of the original <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Star">Death Star</a>, the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire">Galactic Empire</a> began construction on a newer and better armed battle station, one more powerful than the original. Before it could be used on the galaxy, it was ultimately destroyed by the Millennium Falcon, a YT-1300 light freighter, after a critical hit on its reactor core.</p>
